### Size 20

In `Size20`, there is a proof that all 6 FMs in `sz20_6.txt` are nonhalting:
```
[4/15, 3/14, 275/2, 7/11, 3/5]
[5/6, 4/35, 539/2, 3/11, 5/7]
[5/6, 539/2, 4/35, 3/11, 5/7]
[5/6, 44/35, 49/2, 3/11, 5/7]
[28/15, 3/22, 25/2, 11/7, 3/5]
[5/6, 49/2, 44/35, 3/11, 5/7]
```

The files are numbered from `Sz20_6_1.lean` to `Sz20_6_6.lean`. These files were generated by <https://github.com/int-y1/BBFractran/blob/main/other/gen_lean.py> and the proof of `sorry` was filled in manually.
