Random proofs in Lean 4.

## tao_analysis_i

This is my attempt at formalizing Terence Tao's Analysis I.
I gave up in the middle of chapter 4 because setoids were not fun to work with.

This project can compile under Lean 4.27.0-rc1.

## rayleigh_beatty

This is my attempt at formalizing [Wikipedia's proof of Rayleigh's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatty_sequence#Second_proof). My attempt was successful.

I submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/7027) to mathlib4 and it was merged after some fairly heavy modifications. The mathlib4 docs are available [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/NumberTheory/Rayleigh.html).

This project can compile under Lean 4.10.0-rc2, but is not maintained anymore. See mathlib4 for the maintained version.

## SquarePyramid

This is my attempt at formalizing Anglin's proof of the [cannonball problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannonball_problem). My attempt was successful and I created a summary PDF ([link](SquarePyramid/cannonball_summary.pdf)).

This project can compile under Lean 4.27.0-rc1.

## BusyLean

Formalizing some math from [bbchallenge](https://bbchallenge.org/story) and [busycoq](https://github.com/meithecatte/busycoq).

This project can compile under Lean 4.27.0-rc1.

## BBfLean

BBf = Busy Beaver function for Fractran programs. See the [wiki](https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Fractran) for more details.

This project can compile under Lean 4.27.0-rc1.
